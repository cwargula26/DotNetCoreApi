# PhoenixQuestions    What is a 'Traceability Api'?        Are there different Apis for different functions?        Are there different Apis that offer the same functionality and each consumer can select the provider they wish to use?        Could a 'consumer' of Phoenix register with multiple Apis for the same functionality?    # Issues with Levitian1. Lack of documentation (Swagger)1. Lack of standards around variable capitalization1. Credentials are in different places for Gets v Posts## Employee API1. Allowed to create multiple employees with the same exact information1. On the Employee Get All call why is the order of the employee xml in a different order for each employee1. role is required on the create employee call## Customer API1.

Handling API creds to Leviathan1. I think a factory pattern would probably be more fitting for the service layers    the directions were a bit vague on this, but my guess is that each customer could be registered with one, possibly multiple    providers. A service factory would allow me to select the correct service provide based on the user of the API1. Add swagger documentation# TODOS1. Clean up async warnings1. Add error handling1. Create customer call to Leviathan is failing with 'invalid employeeid' (postman)
